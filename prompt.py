        "question": "How does the AI chef generate recipes using the ingredients in my kitchen?",
        "answer": "The AI chef uses a combination of ingredient-based filtering and recipe databases to generate meal suggestions. It checks the available ingredients in your kitchen, suggests recipes that use as many of those ingredients as possible, and provides options to customize them. If certain ingredients are missing, the AI can recommend suitable substitutions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the AI chef recommend a recipe based on my dietary preferences?",
        "answer": "Yes! The AI chef takes into account your dietary preferences—such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb—when generating recipe suggestions. It ensures the recipes meet your requirements by filtering out unsuitable ingredients and suggesting alternatives if necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if one of my ingredients is about to expire?",
        "answer": "When an ingredient is nearing its expiration date, the app will notify you and recommend recipes that can use that ingredient. This helps minimize food waste by suggesting ways to incorporate soon-to-expire ingredients into your meals."
    },
    {
        'question': 'How does the AI improve its recipe recommendations over time?',
        'answer': 'The AI learns from your feedback, favorite recipes, and cooking habits. By tracking the recipes you’ve enjoyed and the ingredients you commonly use, the AI refines its suggestions, making them more personalized and relevant to your preferences.'
    },
    {
        'question': 'Can I save my own recipes in the app?',
        'answer': 'Absolutely! You can save your own recipes by manually inputting them, using a photo upload feature where the app extracts the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), or by scraping recipes from the web with a URL.'
